    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This is a project to create a space for people to play, talk about, and
      watch others play indie games over coffee and food. Unlike traditional
      arcades which are today loud, unaccommodating, and cater to old or
      hardcore gamers, this will be a relaxing space that anyone with an
      interest in games can enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>Periodically there will be tournaments and other game-related events.</p>

    <h2>Current state</h2>
    <p>
      The arcade cafe is currently in the planning stages, with a tentative
      opening expected in early 2025.
    </p>
    <p>At the current time the name of the arcade has not yet been decided.</p>
    <a id="system"></a>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>A customer enters the store</li>
      <li>
        They order at the counter. Each menu item includes 1 or more "play
        tokens". They get an NFC card charged with their tokens to use while in
        the store.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the customer waits for their order they can start playing games or
        watch others (or demo videos) on the big screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the customer gets tired of playing games, they can order a drink and
        take a break to watch others.
      </li>
      <li>
        The customer can purchase additional tokens or get additional tokens
        when ordering drinks or food.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The store staff will help players play games, find other players for
      multiplayer games,

    <h2>Benefits for developers</h2>
    <p>
      For indie developers, there are a lot of benefits to having a game in the
      arcade. In no particular order:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It's an additional source of revenue - aside from a small amount of work
        adapting the game there's no costs.
      </li>
      <li>
        It provides exposure from other players playing the game in the arcade.
      </li>
      <li>
        If someone discovers the game at the arcade, they may enjoy it enough to
        purchase it themselves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiplayer games have limited lifespans due to needing an active player
        pool. But at the arcade there's an always-available pool of players
        (other customers).
      </li>
      <li>
        Home gaming tends to favor long-form games with tens of hours of
        content, but a game with only 5 or 10 minutes of content is viable in an
        arcade setting.
      </li>
      <li>
        The arcade provides a way to do limited early or demo releases and
        gather feedback.
      </li>
      <li>
        The arcade is a great location to hold release events, tournaments, and
        other promotional activities.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <a id="games"></a>
    <h2>What sorts of games?</h2>
    <p>
      The arcade/cafe format is best suited to games that are easy to pick up
      and where an average play lasts around 5 minutes. The games can be single-
      or 2-player, or possibly allow local multiplayer within the arcade. The
      game should not have music, to keep cafe noise levels reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Traditional arcade games</li>
      <li>Racing games</li>
      <li>Sports games</li>
      <li>Boss rush games</li>
      <li>Co-operative puzzle games</li>
      <li>Game-jam games or experimental games</li>
      <li>Game demos - a self-contained segment of a larger game</li>
      <li>Short narrative games</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A longer game that has many stages could be modified so that a single play
      is a single level, with a level-select screen.
    </p>
    <a id="adapting"></a>
    <h2>Preparing a game</h2>
    <p>
      Basically, games must not have an intro/main menu/settings/tutorial/pause
      screen (at most a player select screen) and must accept tokens.
    </p>
    <p>There are two approaches to adapting a game:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The arcade handles payment and player select - this is the easiest
          option.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game can define the minimum and maximum number of players, and the
          arcade software will handle player selection and token payments. Once
          players and payments are selected, the game will be launched. The game
          can move immediately to gameplay.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The game handles payment and player select - this is the most flexible
          option.
        </p>
        <p>
          The arcade has a simple HTTP API for requesting and accepting play
          tokens. When a player selects the game, the game will be immediately
          launched. The game is responsible for allowing players to join and
          receive tokens via the HTTP API.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the most flexible option, allowing a custom player-select
          screen and advanced payment mechanics, like paying to revive after
          failure or for in-game boosts.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
